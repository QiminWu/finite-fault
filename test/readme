Finite Fault Inversion Tests

Invert data from 38 teleseismic stations recorded for the 1995 Colima-Jalisco EQ
assuming a rectangular 200km by 100km fault divided into 200 10km-by-10km subfaults.
The hypocenter is at a depth of 15km and is placed 50 km from the left edge of the fault
and 50km from the top.
The fault has a strike of 300 degrees, dip of 15 degrees, and rake of 90 degrees.
A single time window is used assuming a rupture velocity of 3 km/sec.
Two runs are included:  one that applies no linear constraints using the code LISA
to perform the inversion, and a second run that uses LISASS code to apply
an internally-computed spatial-smoothing and moment-minimization weight.
The LISA results are in directory invNSM, and the LISASS results are in directory invSS

STEPS:

1. run CADIN to produce CADIN.DAT file  (see cadin.log file)

2. compile CADLAC using the included ARSZCAD.DAT file
Note that the pathname to the RAYS directory must be specified correctly 
in the CADLAC subroutine RAYGUN

3. run CADLAC:   cadlac < cadin.dat > outfile
(CADLAC produces CADBIN.DAT output file in binary format)

4. run TELMOD to produce TELMBIN.DAT file of synthetics (binary) file
(see telmod.log file)

5. run JULIEW to set up synthetics file (telmbin.dat) and data file (telPtpr38.dat)
for inversion (see julieW.log file)

6. run LISA to perform the inversion (see lisa.log file), or alternatively run LISASS
(see lisaSS.log file).

7. run VANGODSHJ to create postscript plot files comparing observed records
with synthetics at all stations (see vangodshJ.log file)

8. run PLISAXYZ to write out a file of fault slip (contr01.dat) that can be contoured
using Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) routines (see plisaXYZ.log file)

9. run shell script PLTSLIP.CSH to create a postscript file (grdplt.ps)
of fault slip gridded on a rectangular fault using GMT commands.
to run, type:  csh pltslip.csh contr01.dat
